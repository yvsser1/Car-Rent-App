# `request-animation-frame-timeout`

## Rationale

For some weird reason, in Chrome, `setTimeout()` would lag up to a second (or more) behind. Turns out, Chrome developers have deprecated `setTimeout()` API entirely without asking anyone. Replacing `setTimeout()` with `requestAnimationFrame()` can work around that Chrome bug. The timer-freezing behavior of Chrome is inherently retarded, so this workaround wouldn't be required if they designed their corporate web browser properly.
